# Overview

Devolution Beta is sleek and clean bot made for moderation in discord. The bot is both self hosted and server hosted, meaning you can host it and maintain it yourself, or rely on us to keep it up and running! 

[Installation](#installation) is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Aside
from installation and updating.

# Installation

After installing discord.py you can simply clone the bot and use the line **python bot.py**
