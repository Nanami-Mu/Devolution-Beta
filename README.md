# Overview

Devolution Beta is sleek and clean bot made for moderation in discord. The bot is both self hosted and server hosted, meaning you can host it and maintain it yourself, or rely on us to keep it up and running!

**The base set of modules includes:**

- Provides tons of useful features (userinfo, serverinfo, role management, avatar stealer, rename)
- Comes with a full blown economy, which has a few minigames such as Slots and blackjack.
- Moderation features (kick/ban/hackban/punish/warnings, chat cleanup and more)
- Some fun commands to use against your friends. (insult, speak as the bot)
- Music features (Youtube Links and names)
- Gif search and random gif generator
- Leveling system with XP
- Custom embed generator

Devolution uses a complex method of storing data through the use of Databases. Meaning that your information is kept safe, encrypted and backed up at all times. It also allows for quick access, with low memory usage and millions of queries per minute.

[Installation](#installation) is easy, and you do **NOT** need to know anything about coding! Aside
from installation and updating.
